Fifty-Five Plus magazine and website is one of Ontario’s top lifestyle publications for seniors [1]. According to the client, it has with a dedicated readership of over 30,000 subscribers spanning Toronto, Ottawa, and the surrounding regions [1]. For decades, the magazine has been a trusted resource, providing content specifically tailored to older adults on topics like retirement living, health, travel, and community involvement [2]. Their core mission is to empower seniors and their families with information that is both accessible and easy to use, whether in print or online [2].

The Coyle Media Group owns the Fifty-Five Plus magazine and website [3]. Clients are Bryan Wiltsie, the Director of Operations, Digital Media & Publishing, and Jon Hudon, the Interactive Media Design Manager.

The client’s system request is a retirement residence listing built into its website using WordPress. The client has shared they bought and are currently using Envato theme components. They want us to make the managed retirement residence listing component through embedding an iframe.

The purpose of the project is to develop a comprehensive and user-friendly retirement directory that would better serve its audience, especially older adults looking for housing options. According to the client, this new module is poised to be the only one of its kind in Ontario, offering a single, searchable list of retirement homes from Toronto to Ottawa.

This project's scope is to create and launch a dynamic retirement directory that lets users search by region, amenities, location, and other filters. The system will feature a clean design tailored for seniors. It will be designed to benefit both site visitors (the users) and administrators (like Bryan and Jon) and allow staff to easily make updates using Excel files. The project will also be built to work within the existing website's structure.

The end-users for this new system include older adults with varying levels of comfort with technology, as well as their family members and caregivers. On the administrative side, Bryan and Jona will handle weekly updates using an Excel file, without the need for a live database or API at this stage.

The Coyle Media Group, which owns the popular Fifty-Five Plus magazine and website, has identified a significant opportunity to better serve its readership of seniors and their families. This project is aimed at providing a centralized, user-friendly, and accessible directory that will be the only one of its kind in Ontario. The initiative aligns with the magazine’s core mission to empower seniors with relevant and easy-to-use information. 

This project marks the beginning of the client's efforts to create a dedicated retirement directory. There is no prior system or history to build upon. They have the database of retirement homes where they gather the information from an online form in their website. Now it is time to present that data in their website. The decision to create this system was driven by the desire to meet the evolving needs of their audience, the fifty-five and plus.
